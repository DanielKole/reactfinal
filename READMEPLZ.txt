On first git clone of this repository (after making sure you're on your own fork), navigate to the directory where you've placed this and run "npm install" to automatically add all necessary node modules.

===This is going here just for you, Peta===

To add a remote for updating your files:

"git remote add upstream https://github.com/Rofloflgus/reactfinal.git"

And then you can do

"git pull upstream develop" 

to update all of your files according to what everyone's done.

And just so this is in writing where everyone can see it:
DON'T TRY TO PUSH TO THIS REPOSITORY. AGAIN, CREATE A NEW FORK AND PUSH TO THAT.
